## Introduction
- Stress is important, hard to quantify

- Topography creates substantial stress fields in high-relief areas
    - Both weight of topography ($\rho g z$) and shear stresses from slope
    
- Topographic stresses may influence fault activity
    - put faults nearer to or farther from failure
    - reorient shear stresses on faults
    - interaction of earthquake-rupture with heterogeneous static stresses

- Topographic stresses may be used to constrain tectonic stress in active fault
  environments
    - S = M + T + P = $\lambda$

- We want to do both
    - Wenchuan earthquake is a good candidate
        - large, well studied
        - occurred at base of major topography
        - significant changes in fault rake that are vaguely correlated w/ topo
    - We calculate topographic stresses
        - magnitudes, orientations, etc.
        - compare with slip stuff
    - Then we constrain tectonic stresses
        - rakes, magnitudes, etc.
