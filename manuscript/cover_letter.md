Dear Dr. Nowack,

We respectfully submit this manuscript, *The weight of the mountains:
Constraints on tectonic stress, friction, and fluid pressure in the 2008
Wenchuan earthquake from estimates of topographic loading*, for consideration
for publication in *Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth*. The
manuscript concerns the calculation of crustal stresses produced by topography
in the Longmen Shan and Sichuan Basin region of eastern Tibet, and the effects
of those stresses on faulting, particularly on the 2008 M 7.9 Wenchuan event.
The work presented addresses a range of topics, including quantification of
topographic and tectonic stresses, other parameters of importance to fault
mechanics such as fault friction and pore fluid pressure, and tectonic and
geodynamic concepts including the role of topography in crustal deformation and
localization of strain.

Given the subject matter, we feel this work would be an excellent contribution
to *JGR: Solid Earth*, which has published the virtually all of the few similar
works on the quantification of topographic stresses, as well as a large number
of studies on related topics such as fault mechanics and geodynamics. Therefore,
we hope that the broad readership of *JGR: Solid Earth* would find much of
interest in our manuscript.

Best regards,
Richard Styron
