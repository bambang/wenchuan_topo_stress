Dear [Editor],

We respectfully submit this manuscript, "title", for consideration for
publication
in *Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth*. The manuscript concerns
the calculation of crustal stresses produced by topography in the Longmen Shan and
Sichuan Basin region of eastern Tibet, and the effects of those stresses on
faulting, particularly on the 2008 M 7.9 Wenchuan event. The work presented
addresses a range of topics, including quantification of topographic and tectonic
stresses, other parameters of importance to fault mechanics such as fault friction
and pore fluid pressure, and tectonic and geodynamic concepts including the role
of topography in crustal deformation and localization of strain.

Given the subject matter, we feel this work would be an excellent contribution
to *JGR: Solid Earth*, which has published the virtually all of the few similar
works on the quantification of topographic stresses, as well as a large number
of studies on related topics such as fault mechanics and geodynamics. Therefore,
we hope that the broad readership of *JGR: Solid Earth* would find much of
interest in our manuscript.

Best regards,
Richard Styron
