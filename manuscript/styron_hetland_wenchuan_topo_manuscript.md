# Topographic stresses and the Wenchuan earthquake

## Abstract

## Introduction
- Stress is important, hard to quantify
Stress is of fundamental importance to many processes in the earth. During
deformation, both the isotropic (pressure) and anisotropic (shear) components
of stress exert control on the deformation state of the earth at any point
in the brittle regime.  However, unlike other fundamental quantities such
as temperature, stress is extremely difficult to measure *in situ* and is
typically inferred from strain.

- Topography creates substantial stress fields in high-relief areas
    - Both weight of topography ($\rho g z$) and shear stresses from slope
    
- Topographic stresses may influence fault activity
    - put faults nearer to or farther from failure
    - reorient shear stresses on faults
    - interaction of earthquake-rupture with heterogeneous static stresses

- Topographic stresses may be used to constrain tectonic stress in active fault
  environments
    - $S = M + T + P - \lambda$

- We want to do both
    - Wenchuan earthquake is a good candidate
        - large, well studied
        - occurred at base of major topography
        - significant changes in fault rake that are vaguely correlated w/ topo
    - We calculate topographic stresses
        - magnitudes, orientations, etc.
        - compare with slip stuff
    - Then we constrain tectonic stresses
        - rakes, magnitudes, etc.

### Background on topographic stresses
- Orogenic/range scales: 
    - Molnar and Lyon-Caen, Copley, Dalmayrac and Molnar
    - coulomb wedges, 
    - thin sheets
    - Bollinger et al

- Smaller scales:
    - Liu and Zoback
    - anything else?

### Background on Wenchuan event
- Geology and physiography
    - big mountains
    - slow fault

- Earthquake stuff
    - size, etc.
    - variability of rake along strike
    - previous work on stress fields
