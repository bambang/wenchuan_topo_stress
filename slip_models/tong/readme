Coseismic Slip Model of the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake Derived From Joint Inversion of InSAR, GPS and Field Data

NOTE: THIS IS AN UPDATED MODEL. 

Changes:

2009 Dec:
Including more ScanSAR data on the northwest side of the Longmenshan fault.

origin of the cartesian coordinate 
This origin is used when converting from local coordinate to the
lat/lon coordinate from the source?.dat. 

Lon: 104.2 deg
Lat: 31.4 deg

fault location and geometry:
source1.dat (north Beichuan segment)

xo: 100.37 km 
yo: 120.91 km
zo: 0 km 
length: 95.73 km
width: 30 km
dip: 70 deg
strike: -128 deg

source2.dat (central Beichuan segment)

xo: 9.91 km 
yo: 34.70 km
zo: 0 km 
length: 154.82 km
width: 35 km
dip: 50 deg
strike: -137 deg


source3.dat (south Beichuan segment)

xo: -77.35 km 
yo: -48.99 km
zo: 0 km 
length: 87.60 km
width: 45 km
dip: 35 deg
strike: -128 deg


source4.dat (Pengguan segment)

xo: -11.36 km 
yo: -2.31 km
zo: 0 km 
length: 82.07 km
width: 20 km
dip: 25 deg
strike: -137 deg


xo, yo, zo is location of the center 
of the top edge of the fault plane in 
cartesian coordinates. 
 
More descriptions:
The xo and yo are the relative location in cartesian coordinates
with respect to the origin of the cartesian coordinate assuming the
positive x means the center top of the fault is to the east of the  
origin  (Lon:104.2 deg Lat:31.4 deg.)
postive y means the center top of the fault is to the north of the  
origin  (Lon:104.2 deg Lat:31.4 deg.)

In this case the xo 100.37 km means the center top of the fault is  
to the east of the origin 100.37 km.
  the yo 120.91 km means the center top of the fault is to the  
north of the origin 120.91 km. 
zo is zero in this case, which means that the top edge of the fault segment is at the surface of the half space. 
The half space is assumed to be at 500m elevation.

Format of source?.dat:

x1(km) x2(km) x3(km) x4(km) y1(km) y2(km) y3(km) y4(km) strike-slip(cm) dip-slip(cm)

x1,x2,x3,x4 are the along-strike location of the four corners of the rectangular fault patches.
y1,y2,y3,y4 are the along-dip location of the four corners of the rectangular fault patches.
x1,x2,x3,x4 and y1,y2,y3,y4 are in the coordinate of the fault plane and has nothing to do with xo yo zo.

Each rectangular fault patches may have different length and width (see the reference).
strike-slip is negative, corresponding to right-lateral.
dip-slip is positive, corresponding to thrust.
